= Entente Invasion

One report streams into the War Minister's Office. Then another, and another. By lunch, a hundred reports have reached the eyes of the Prime Minister; the Cabinet. The French, alongside the British and the opportunists of Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes have begun moving forces into Italian lands.

Our forces; albeit of course expecting a potential intervention, are unable to hold the invaders back. The colonies go first, then Sardinia, then Sicily, Naples, Rome. In our place, the King and his den of snakes return back into his throne of greed, built upon the corpses of Italian men as he thanks the powers that brought him back to the throne.

The same power that massacre the citizens he so desperately pretends to represent.
